`rust-hn` is a Rust implementation of a website very similar to [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com).

HackerNews is known for its minimalist design and brilliant community-driven discussions. We wanted a similar platform tailored specifically for crypto enthusiasts, so we built one ourselves! And because we believe in the power of open-source, we’ve made rust-hn available for anyone to customize and create their own version of HN!
